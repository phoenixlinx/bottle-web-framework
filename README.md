### Welcome to my Bottle repostiory.

In this repository you can follow me along as I progress with my youtube series.

Check out my youtube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIO3UV9ODwNCpkACUf-ReLiFxaoTU5ktn).

All you have to do to be able to run these examples is to issue these commands, assuming you have [python3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

```bash
pip install bottle
pip install bottle_sqlite
```
